# Project README

## What it does
Utilizing INRIXâ€™s extensive traffic data and its Camera APIs, our project analyzes multiple camera feeds from a set coordinate square specified by the user and gathers images. Images are passed through the Llama AWS service to determine if trash is present and identify the trash type and amount.

## Why is it useful?
Our product provides a more organized alternative for litter collection and street maintenance. With a more centralized approach, individuals within a community or even businesses can be incentivized to become more active in their communal upkeep.
